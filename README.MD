# The claypot

Complete the `claypot` function in index.js abiding by the following conditions
- From value `from` to value `to`, print out all values in between.
- However, if the value is divisible by 3, print `Clay` instead
- If the value is divisible by 5, print `pot` instead.
- If the value is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `Claypot` instead.
- The expected output should be like the one in `ExpectedOutput.png`
- Commit your code to `git`

Notes:
- If you need to test, open `index.html` in your browser, open up the development tools, and open up the console
- Then, simply call the function out like this: `claypot(1, 30)`
